Forest Cover Classification DLSP PRoject Description

In this project, I will be using deep learning to forecast forest cover type (the most prevalent form of tree cover) using just cartographic data. The actual forest cover type for a specific 30 Ã— 30 meter cell was identified using US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System data. The cover types are as follows:

1. Spruce/Fir
2. Lodgepole Pine
3. Ponderosa Pine
4. Cottonwood/Willow
5. Aspen
6. Douglas-fir
7. Krummholz
